# 490.-The-Maze
This repository contains Python solutions for solving the "490. The Maze" problem on LeetCode using both Breadth-First Traversal (BFS) and Depth-First Traversal (DFS) approaches. Additionally, it includes a PowerPoint presentation detailing the manual solution process for solving the problem using BFS and DFS.

Problem Description:

The problem involves navigating a maze represented as a grid, with the goal of determining whether a ball starting from a specific cell can reach a destination cell by rolling horizontally or vertically until it hits a wall.
Approaches:

Breadth-First Traversal (BFS): Systematically explores the maze in a breadth-first manner, enqueueing neighboring cells and dequeuing them for further exploration.
Depth-First Traversal (DFS): Systematically explores the maze in a depth-first manner, recursively exploring each path until reaching the destination or hitting a dead end.
Manual Solution Process:

The PowerPoint presentation outlines a manual solution process for both BFS and DFS approaches, providing step-by-step instructions for navigating the maze from the starting cell to the destination.
Usage:

You can use the provided Python solutions to solve the "490. The Maze" problem programmatically. Additionally, the PowerPoint presentation serves as a guide for understanding the manual solution process.
